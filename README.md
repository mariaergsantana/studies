# STUDIES
This is a repository for my studies on HTML, CSS and JavaScript

I am following the guidelines of the books written by Jon Duckett on the topics. I decided to save the codes here so I have a place where I can go back to throughout my studies.

My codes are devided by the chapters in the books.
